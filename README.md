# Weather-Station

## Description

This project involves building a weather station using an ESP8266 microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor to collect temperature and humidity data. The collected data is processed locally on the microcontroller. 

### Steps Involved:

1. **Data Collection from DHT11 :**
   - The DHT11 sensor is used to measure temperature and humidity.
   - Data is sampled at regular intervals by the ESP8266 microcontroller.

2. **Data Processing :**
   - Data collected from the sensor is processed locally on the ESP8266.
   - Basic processing may include data validation and formatting.

3. **Data Transmission to ThingSpeak via WiFi :**
   - Processed data is transmitted to ThingSpeak, an IoT platform, via WiFi.
   - ThingSpeak allows for real-time data visualization and analysis.

4. **Data Transfer to Google Sheets via Google Apps Script :**
   - Additionally, data is transferred to Google Sheets using Google Apps Script.
   - This provides a structured way to store and manage historical data.

5. **Data Visualization :**
   - Data collected and stored in ThingSpeak and Google Sheets (code.gs) can be visualized using graphs and charts.
   - Visualization helps in understanding trends and patterns in the weather data.
